The Sixth Party Rally of the Movement is taking place in a year when, for the first time, a thousand-year-old dream has become reality. The German nation has arisen. In fourteen short months, we have brought about unity among the German people. We have created a new Reich. We have given the German people a government that is the expression of the national will. The Party is not merely a tool of the state. It shall and must be the guide and soul of the German people. It must give form and content to the state. The Party is the political leadership. The Party must not be the servant of public opinion, but its master. It must control it and lead it. We must raise our people not to follow public opinion, but to form it. The German people did not rise again through slogans. They rose because a new faith was born. And this faith is embodied in a man, a movement, and a mission: Germany!. The German youth must be swift as a greyhound, tough as leather, and hard as Krupp steel. We have removed the old spirit of weakness and compromise and replaced it with strength, discipline, and loyalty. From now on, only one authority shall exist in Germany: the authority of the National Socialist movement. One people, one empire, one leader!.
